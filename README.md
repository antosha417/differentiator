# differentiator
Program which uses recursive destent to parse function in file "data.txt" and some variables with errors. Then uses diffirentiation ot estimate erroror of given function and with a help of LaTex make nice looking report.

Example of file "data.txt"  
"<(g*R*r)/(4*({\pi})^2*{z_0})>

\[g 9.8 0\]  
\[R 114.6 0.5\]  
\[r 30.5 0.3\]  
\[{z_0} 214 1\]  
\[{\pi} 3.14 0 \]"
